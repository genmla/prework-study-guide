          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <li>Elements nested inside previous elements have a child-parent relationship. Nesting elemnents are the child elements.</li>

              <li>Do child elements have a minimum of three?</li>

              <li>Does a parent element need a minimum of three elements nesting inside?</li>

          <li>The difference between elements and tags: the element is the entire element from opening to end (including conent?, etc.), the tag is only what appears in the angle brackets</li>

        <h3>GitHub Description</h3>

        <ul>

          <li>GitHub is a remote cloud space to save and collaborate on projects</li>

          <li>GitHub stores repositories, or repos, which act as folders for storing files with code and information on a specific project</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>GitHub Capabilities</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Adding a repo in GitHub:</strong></li>

            <ul>
              <li>Click + icon next to profile picture in GitHub account</li>

              <li>Select New Repository from drop down</li>

              <li>Fill out repository name, use only lower case letters and dashes for spaces</li>

              <li>Make public to collaorate, or private to collaborate with only invited coders</li>

              <li>Add a README file to give information on the project to other developers</li>

              <li>Add a license, boot camp suggests using the MIT License by default for our purposes</li>

            </ul>

            <li><strong>Creating Issues</strong></li>

              <ul>
                
                <li>Issues help track progress</li>

                <li>Issue usually contain User Story, which defines goal of user, and Acceptance Criteria, which defines when the goal is reached</li>

                  <ul>
                    
                    <li>User Story: "As [User], I want to [Goal]</li>

                    <li>Acceptance Criteria: GIVEN [goal/project], WHEN [this happens], THEN [this results]</li>

                  </ul>
                <li>We created one issue for every language we are introduced to in the prework lesson, as well as one issue for Readme and one for Deployment</li>

                <li>Written in Markdown language, which was wrongly indicated in lesson, but you can intuit it from selecting font in GitHub</li>

                <li>Create new issues by going into the repo and navigating to the Issues tab</li>
              
              </ul>

            <li><strong>Working in GitHub</strong></li>

            <li><a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">GitHub Docs on GitHub flow</a> was provided as a link to the workflow of modifying a repo</li>

              <ul>
                
                <li>Crete a local feature branches to add to the main branch of code in the repo/project</li>

                <li>Make commits of the changes made in the feature branch to describe changes in code</li>

                <li>Push local branch to the remote repo and make a pull request to merge changes to main branch</li>

                <li>Pull request (PR) is sent to fellow developer to approve changes and give second eye; then merge is accepted</li>

                <li>Merge the branch after the PR is approved</li>

              </ul>
            
            <li><strong>Creating a feature branch</strong> to add to main branch in repo</li>

              <ul>

                <li>navigate to the appropriate directory containing code files and enter "code ." command</li>

                <li>In coding program, check to make sure all the coding files show up</li>

                <li>Chech the branch with "git status" command to make sure you are in the main branch</li>

                <li>Add a feature branch to create new branch for work without changing the main branch using the "git checkout -b [branch]</li>

                <li>Verify you are in the newly created feature branch with the "git status" command</li>

                <li>Add all modifications to the newly created feature branch witht the "git add -A" command</li>

                <li>Document changes with a commit message with the "git commit -m" command and putting the commit message in quotes</li>

                <li>Check that the main local branch is in synch with remote branch in GitHub with the "git pull origin main" command</li>

                <li>Push local feature branch to the main branch with the "git push origin [branch]" command</li>

                <li>Go to repo in GitHub, find newly added feature branch and make pull request for review and merge</li>

                <li>Main branch should have the modifications made in the local branch after merging</li>
              
              </ul>

          <li>git checkout -b [branch name]: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

          <li>git add: adds changes to the current branch to the staging area</li>

          <li>git add -A: add ALL changes to the current branch fo the staging area</li>

          <li>git commit -m "[commit message]": commits changes to current branch with message (-m) in quotes</li>

          <li>git pull origin [branch]: make sure current branch is synched with base branch in GitHub. See further notes for compoents:</li>
            
          <li>git push origin [branch]: push (modified) branch into remote GitHub branch</li>
