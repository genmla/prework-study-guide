# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a study guide for bootcamp students to reference HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript notes taken during the guided bootcamp lessons. Building the project helped reinforce the topics presented and the resulting project will serve as reference. Going into this project, I had no experience with CSS, JavaScript, or git, and it allowed me to execute the skills I learned.

This guide can be used as a study reference for the HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript topics taught in the bootcamp. Opening the DevTools console allows the user to see how the JavaScript runs, which is set up to list the four topics and to generate a suggestion for which topic to study first.
